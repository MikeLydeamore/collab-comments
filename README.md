# Comment Tracker Extension

A VS Code extension for collaborative commenting with author tracking, timestamps, and threaded discussions - similar to Overleaf's commenting feature.

## Features

- **Inline Comments**: Add comments that appear inline in your editor and move with the text
- **Author Tracking**: Every comment records who wrote it and when
- **Threaded Replies**: Reply to comments to create discussion threads
- **Resolve/Unresolve**: Mark comment threads as resolved when issues are addressed
- **Delete with Confirmation**: Delete entire threads or individual replies with safety confirmations
- **Persistent Storage**: Comments are saved in `.vscode/collab-comments.json` and sync via Git
- **Configurable Author**: Set your default name in settings to avoid repeated prompts
- **Any File Type**: Works on any file - not just QMD or Markdown
